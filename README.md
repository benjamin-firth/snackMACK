## Welcome Ben's 'snackMACK' food and dating app!

[Ben Firth](https://github.com/benjamin-firth)

Have you ever wanted to impress people you meet on dating apps with your knowledge of local food truck cuisine? Look no further!

## This app utilizes:
- React / Redux
- Router
- Sass/SCSS
- React-Leaflet Library
- The streetfoodapp API
- Enzyme / Jest

## Setup

Feel free to pull down this repo, run 'npm install'.

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:3000/`. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

If you want, feel free to run `npm test` to check out our coverage and make sure everything is passing!

### Wins

This project was a lot of fun. I would say some of the best things that were accomplished: 
1. Implementing testing in React for nested async functions such as fetch. 
2. Implementing a leaflet map, and then figuring out how to get it to dynamically render (as it doesn't render with the DOM) in a way to show the button changes.
3. It was important to us to get as close to 100% tested as possible. Besides some Leaflet and Router testing, I was able to test everything else.

### Challenges

Most of my successes were also large challenges that I had to overcome, so this list is a bit of a repeat:
1. Implementing a leaflet map, and then figuring out how to get it to dynamically render (as it doesn't render with the DOM) in a way to show the button changes.
2. Testing some of the more nested async functions as well as testing Leaflet.

### Future Iterations

If given more time:
1. I would have created a more interactive experience for the user. I want to implement a text feature so that once you've picked a location, you can send that as a text to your potential date.
2. I'd also like to turn this into a Progressive Web App for phone use.
